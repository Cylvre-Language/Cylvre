### Fixes
- [x] Else statement fix (although still need to fix bytecode generation issue)
- [ ] Functions fix 
- [ ] Java API an other Cylvre files reference fix
- [x] field without value declaration fix (althogh the main method doesn't generate even if included.)	
- [ ] variable declaration without value fix (related to previous fix)

### FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT AWAY (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Arrays (help/research needed)
- [ ] Comments 
- [ ] String concatenation messages for println()
- [x] print() for System.out.print()
- [x] print_err() for System.err.println()
- [ ] import statement to handle Java API referencing (after fix) 
- [ ] Cylvre CLI to compile and run Cylvre Files (using `forge` and `run`)
- [ ] User Input

### IMPORTANT FEATURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN LATER STAGES
- [ ] match statement
- [ ] Concurrency (Coroutines)
