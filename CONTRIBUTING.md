# Contributing to Cylvre

First of all, thanks for contributing to Cylvre! :partying_face: 

It is the dedication of people like you that help this project by submitting issues, pull requests etc that drive this project and make it better.

   - If any issue is marked with the `in progress` label, then it is being worked on by someone. If it has the label and the issue has been sitting for a long time, you can comment on the issue stating that you have an interest in it.
